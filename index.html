            <hr>
            <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capatalize">The quality of the food is great. The taste is awesome. The prices are justified when compared to the quantity. The packaging and presentation was also on point.Apart from being a historic place, it has a cosy casual ambience and amazing food at affordable price. There are not alot of times when you come across a place where you get authentic food, good music, a proper theatre above and is also easy on pocket.

                I had heard about this place from my friends and they loved it so much that they happened to visit there 2 to 3 times. So on my first visit to Mumbai this place was on top of my list.

                I had reached prithvi cafe at around 4 in the afternoon, I was full from the lunch I had and also the place was packed so I thought I should walk around the beach for a while. I walked for almost an hour (I had started enjoying it). Then I came back waited for a few minutes and got my table, I was still not hungry, so I ordered just Nachos with mixed veg and cheese and a peach ice tea, just to enjoy the ambience and also to see what the hype was all about.
                Ambience is amazing, the cafe was all packed, there was a long queue by the time it was evening, and the lights became dim and were perfect for a nice good evening. People were enjoying the music and were busy with their regular conversations.
                Overall a perfect place to spend a good evening with friends or if you want to watch a play.
                Next time I am going to go with an empty stomach and try a few more dishe.</h5>

        <p>“Avengers: Endgame” is the culmination of a decade of blockbuster filmmaking, the result of years of work from thousands of people. It is designed to be the most blockbuster of all the blockbusters, a movie with a dozen subplots colliding, and familiar faces from over 20 other movies. It’s really like nothing that Hollywood has produced before, existing not just to acknowledge or exploit the fans of this series, but to reward their love, patience, and undying adoration. The blunt thing you probably want to know most: It’s hard to see serious MCU fans walking away from this disappointed. It checks all the boxes, even ticking off a few ones that fans won’t expect to be on the list. It’s a satisfying end to a chapter of blockbuster history that will be hard to top for pure spectacle. In terms of sheer entertainment value, it’s on the higher end of the MCU, a film that elevates its most iconic heroes to the legendary status they deserve and provides a few legitimate thrills along the way.</p>

        <p>It may be a long time before viewers can appreciate the 2019 remake of "The Lion King" as a freestanding work, instead of judging it against the original. The 1994 version was "Hamlet" plus "Bambi" on the African veldt: a childhood-shaping, Oscar-winning blockbuster, the second-highest grossing feature film of its calendar year, one of the last great hand-drawn Disney animated features (Pixar's original "Toy Story" came out 18 months later), and a tear-producing machine. This remake was controversial long before it opened, mainly because it seemed to take the Walt Disney company's new branding strategy—remaking beloved animated films as CGI-dependent "live action" spectaculars—to its most drastic conclusion. It serves up the same story with different actors, different arrangements of beloved songs and soundtrack cues, a couple of original tunes, a few fresh scenes and sequences, and, of course, photorealistic animals. The latter are the movie's main selling point, so believable that one of my kids remarked afterward that sitting through the film was like watching a nature documentary on mute while the soundtrack to original "The Lion King" played in the background..</p>

According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block</p>

However, international concerns raised at the time were countered by the Brazilian Government, which claimed the fire situation in August was 'normal' and 'below the historical average'.An international team of scientists writing in the journal Global Change Biology say the number of active fires in August was actually three times higher than in 2018 and the highest number since 2010.</p>
